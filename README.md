# pks-deploy

This is a project intended to document and automate the process required for a PKS + NSX-T deployment on vSphere.

## Development

For development, you will clone this repository and submit MRs back to upstream.
This is intended to be used as a sub project pulled together by a meta-project.
You can get the full set of repositories by follow the prep section below.

## Using this for a Deployment

### Preperation

***Do not clone this repository.***
Instead, [install Google Repo](https://source.android.com/source/downloading#installing-repo).

Once you've installed Google Repo, you will use it to download and assemble all the component git repositories.

This processis as follows:

* create and/or change into a directory where you'd like to place all source relevant to this PKS deployment
* then execute the following

`repo init -u git@gitlab.eng.vmware.com:ps-emerging/pks-deploy-meta.git`

...followed by...

`repo sync`

### Configuration

### Bootstrap a VM into vSphere for running the deployment

We'll create a VM in vCenter that can be used to host Concourse, ansible, and any other tools needed to
run this deployment automation.

You can find an existing OVA for this vm at ....???.... or you can go into the [bootstrap directory](bootstrap/)
to create the VM directly in vCenter.  This is how we created the OVA above.

## PKS Deployment step-by-step

[Niran's step-by-step](https://onevmw-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/nevenchen_vmware_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B06F3406E-D0A2-42AE-9F5C-F35583D92EDF%7D&file=Deploy%20NSX-T%20with%20Concourse%20V1%2004-27-2018.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

* Start with a new vcenter, or a new cluster in an existing vcenter
* Use the PoC [Planning Reference](https://vault.vmware.com/group/vault-main-library/document-preview?fileId=38127906) document to vet the planned deployment
* Use the [PKS Configuration Worksheet](https://vault.vmware.com/group/vault-main-library/document-preview?fileId=38127882) to track needed configuration
* Deploy a jump box
  * install pivotal tools (BOSH)
  * install concourse via cli bosh (create env)
  * download and host needed binaries
* apply pipelines for:
  * deploy nsx-t
  * deploy opsman
  * deploy PKS
